Innate Cards									10	
Staffer	Unit	2		1	2	Melee	FALSE		4	
Devout Druid	Unit	1		1	1	Melee	FALSE	When gathering mana if this unit is on a spring you control you gain one additional mana	2	This could be set to "this spring generates two mana" if we were worried about duplicates. I want this to be cheap, but also want this unit to be able to defend itself. 0/1 seems too weak for one gold and 1/1 with this effect might be too strong
Channellers	Worker					N/A	FALSE	T: 1G	4	
Channellers Flip	Worker					N/A	FALSE	T: 1M		I'm thinking of removing this and using other methods to get mana production. I just couldn't find clean ways of utilizing it
						Melee	FALSE			
Common Cards									20	
Bowman	Unit	2		1	1	Ranged	FALSE	If this unit kills another unit you may move it one space	4	
Siege, Druid	Unit	1		1	1	Melee	TRUE		3	
Tranquil Warden	Unit	3		1	2	Melee	FALSE	After this unit takes damage and survives flip it	3	Upped this to three gold since it secretly has three health
Enraged Warden (Tranquil Warden Flip)	Unit	3		2	2	Melee	FALSE			
Siphoner Druid	Unit	2		1	2	Melee	FALSE	When this unit kills another unit gain one mana	3	The Circle of Life
Sudden Bloom	Spell		4			N/A	FALSE	Put up to three common units from your discard pile into empty spaces adjacent to a friendly unit	2	Changed this from being a parasitic tribal revive spell to revive any common minion. It's less narrow now
Channel the Springs	Spell	1				N/A	FALSE	Gain one mana	3	
Mana Bomb	Spell		2			N/A	FALSE	Deal one damage to a unit, if that unit is on a mana spring deal three damage to it instead	1	Is below the curve if the unit isn't on a spring, but is above it if they are. This reinforces that this faction cares about mana
Regrowth	Spell		1			N/A	FALSE	Heal your base one	1	
Champion Cards									4	
Earth Elemental	Unit		4	2	4	Melee	TRUE	4M: Play this unit from your discard pile	1	
High Tide Crasher	Unit		2	1	2	Melee	TRUE	2M: give a friendly unit within two spaces plus one attack this turn, flip this unit	1	High tides with a fluid flipping ability with some sort of buff. This reminds me of Lucio
Low Tide Drifter (High Tide Crasher Flip)	Unit		2	1	2	Melee	TRUE	2M: Heal all adjacent friendly units one, flip this unit.		The front side seems weird since it also heals the water elemental
Kindling Sparks	Unit		2	1	2	Melee	TRUE	When this unit kills another unit flip it	1	Fire is furious and flips when damaged or other damage based triggers
Raging Flames (Kindling Sparks Flip)	Unit			2	2	Ranged	TRUE			If this back side needs to be nerfed I want to try it as a 1/1 or 1/2 with firebreathing
Gale Elemental	Unit		3	1	3	Ranged	TRUE	At the start of your movement phase, you may move all units 1 space in the same direction. (Except the ones that don't have space)	1	ALL UNITS!
